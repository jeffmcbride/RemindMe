# RemindMe
A simple chrome extension to send a message to your browser on a given interval. I created this as I often found myself dehydrated and slouched at work so I wanted a reminder every half hour or hour to drink water and fix my posture.

To install, download folder and unzip, go to Chrome Extensions, turn on developer mode and Load Unpacked solution (there are only two files).

To use, whenever you want to set reminders, click the R icon that will be on your browser, and set your reminder and interval length.
